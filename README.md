# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I would incorporate a gradient for the dark blue backgrounds. This will be easier on the eye and it won't be as jarring of a transition from the lighter backgrounds to the darker ones. I think another feature that would be nice to add, would be photos of the menu items in a banner slideshow below the Menu section. This allows the customer/user to view the items on the menu and it will look appealing to the overall webpage.
